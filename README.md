Genebanks increasingly use molecular markers for routine
    characterization of ex-situ collections and farmer managed diversity. CIP's
    (International Potato Center) genebank presently uses a SSR marker-kit to
    produce molecular profiles for potato accessions. We have been searching
    for a compact graphical representation that shows both
    molecular diversity and accession characteristics - thus permitting
    biologists and collection curators to have a simpler way to interpret
    high-volume data. Inspired by the ancient Andean quipus we devised a graph
    that allows for standardized representation while leaving room for updates
    of the marker kit and the collection of accessions. The graph has been used
    in several CIP publications.
